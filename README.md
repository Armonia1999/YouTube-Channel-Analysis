# YouTube Channel Analysis

In this project we analyze several Youtube channels and present our findings using streamlit by building a web app.

You can easily pick what channels you want to analyze by adding/deleting the channel ID in the specified location at the start of the ***main.py*** file. 

This project uses YouTube Data API to extract the information we want about the channels and then use other libraries such as Pandas, matplotlib , seaborn and emoji to wrangle the data and finally use streamlit to build a dashboard using the data we gathered.

To go through every step (aside from the streamlit) , go and check the jupyter notebook file ***Youtube Channel Analysis Notebook***, and to see all together, including the streamlit code, check ***main.py***

Feel free to hit me up with improvements to the code ! I am still new to Python and open to learn ~


**Note:**
The CSV files we saved (general.csv and videos.csv) we will use to build a Tableau Dashboard.
